## Getting Started

You need to install either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine. In this project, I will use Yarn for installing packages and running scripts.

```sh
yarn install
```


## Start your project

```sh
yarn init
OR
npm init
```

## Install dependencies
This project will start with Chrome broswer and mocha for testing purposes.

```sh
yarn add chromedriver selenium-webdriver
```

```sh
yarn add mocha -D
```
